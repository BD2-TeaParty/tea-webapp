# Tea Shop Webapp
Small project written in JS, React, Redux & Material-UI. Mimics a usable shop page with current functionality:
- Login
- Add/Remove to/from wishlist
- View all items
- Add item to cart
- Remove item from cart
- Change item quantity in cart
- Create order 
- Choose shipping method, payment method
- Apply a discount
   

UI language is in Polish for now.

## Lore
The project was kind of a playground for applying best React/Redux practises and learn css. There's a lot of features that are lacking, css is sometimes a mess and the components' reusability could have been much better. At the same time there is no linter in use, there are no tests and prop-types are missing. However the project's structure is quite decent and redux is (I think) well written. Most of the missing tools / practises are being applied in my main (for now) project - Cactus Calendar, which code is currently private.
